			<h1>Red Squadron</h1>
			Red Squadron was an Alliance Starfighter Corps starfighter squadron active during the Galactic Civil War. Their unit specialties included starfighter dogfighting, convoy raids, convoy escort missions, planetary strafing and bombing runs, and capital ship harassments. Although Red Squadron primarily flew X-wings on their missions, they relied on the Koensayr BTL-A4 Y-wing starfighters for missions relating to heavy bombardment. The squadron most famously fought at the Battle of Yavin and Battle of Endor.

			<h1>Green Squadron</h1>
			This squadron provided cover for Blue Squadron during the Battle of Yavin. Their main goal had been to join Blue Squadron in an attack run on the station's superlaser, and also hopefully distract the Empire from the exhaust port attack.

			<h1>Blue Squadron</h1>
			Blue Squadron participated in the Battle of Endor, though the pilot roster had been revised by this time. Ackbar had originally hoped for a full squadron comprised solely of B-wing starfighters. However, due to an unfortunate shortage of qualified B-wing pilots, three A-wings were used to flesh out the squadron during the battle. The B-wings were maintained by Verpine mechanics, and were equipped with armor-piercing missiles.

			Each of Blue Squadron's three Flights contained three B-wings and one A-wing. The B-wings were charged with striking enemy capital ships while the A-wings kept them safe from starfighter attack. During the battle, the callsign "Blue Wing" was used to denote the squadron as a whole. However, it was also used as a moniker by the squadron's second-in-command after the death of Blue Leader. Blue Squadron's B-wings were also given orders to attack Imperial capital ships.
